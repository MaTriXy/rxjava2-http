Transmit RxJava2 Flowable over http (with non-blocking backpressure).

Status: *pre-alpha* (in development)

## Features
* Apply non-blocking backpressure to streams over networks
* Use whatever serialization library you want (the core supports `Flowable<ByteBuffer>`)
* Supports plain HTTP/HTTPS service (no firewall troubles with WebSockets)
* Uses Servlet 3.1+ asynchronous processing (by default)

## Getting started

### Maven dependency
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.davidmoten</groupId>
  <artifactId>rxjava2-http</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION_HERE</version>
</dependency>
```

### Create servlet
The servlet below exposes the `Flowable.range(1, 1000)` stream across HTTP:

```java
@WebServlet(urlPatterns={"/stream"}, asyncSupported=true)
public class HandlerServlet extends FlowableHttpServlet {
      
    public HandlerServlet() {
        super( request -> 
          Flowable
            .range(1,1000)
            .map(Serializer.javaIo()::serialize)      
        );
    }
}
```
The default behaviour is to schedule requests on `Schedulers.io()` but this is configurable via another `FlowableHttpServlet` constructor.

Bear in mind that each `ByteBuffer` in the server flowable will be reconstituted as is on the client side and you will want to ensure that the client can allocate byte arrays for each item. For example, mobile platforms like Android have quite low max heap sizes so that if the client is one of those platforms you will need to chunk up the data appropriately. (This may be a use-case for supporting [Nested Flowables](#nested-flowables), let me know if you need it).

### Create client
Assuming the servlet above is listening on `http://localhost:8080/stream`, this is how you access it over HTTP:

```java
Flowable<Integer> numbers = 
  Client
   .get("http://localhost:8080/stream")
   .deserialized();
```
More client options are available. Here is an example:

```java
Flowable<Integer> numbers = 
  Client
    .get("https://localhost:8080/stream") 
   Â .method(HttpMethod.GET)  
    .connectTimeoutMs(3000) 
    .readTimeoutMs(30000) 
    .proxy(host, port)
    .sslContext(sslContext)
    .transform(con -> con.setFollowRedirects(true))
    .basicAuth("username", "password")
    .serializer(serializer) // used for deserialization
    .rebatchRequests(128); // necessary to enable backpressure over the network without blocking calls
```

Note that if you need proxy authentication as well then use:

```java
Authenticator authenticator = new Authenticator() {
    public PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
        return (new PasswordAuthentication("user",
                "password".toCharArray()));
    }
};
Authenticator.setDefault(authenticator);
```

### Serializers

`Serializer.javaIo()` can be used to serialize classes that implement `Serializable`. It is much slower than products like *Kryo* or indeed if you have the time, custom serialization.

## Good practices

### Backpressure
To ensure backpressure is applied over the network (so operating system IO buffers don't fill and block threads) it's a good idea to request data in batches:

* apply `rebatchRequests` to the client-side Flowable
* [*rxjava2-extras*](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava2-extras) has a number of request manipulating operators (`minRequest`, `maxRequest` and another version of [`rebatchRequests`](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava2-extras#rebatchrequests) with different features)

### Quiet streams
Note that a long running quiet source Flowable over http(s) is indistinguishable from a chopped connection (by a firewall for instance). To avoid this:

* regularly cancel and reconnect to the stream

OR

* include a heartbeat emission in the Flowable which you filter out on the client side

OR

* put a `timeout` operator on the Flowable on the client side and `retry`

The heartbeat option is especially good if a reconnect could mean missed emissions.

### Orphan streams on the server

It's also a good idea to:

*  put a `timeout` operator on the server Flowable in case a client leaves (or is killed) without cancelling

This goes for any server Flowable, even one that is normally of very short duration. This is because the subscription is retained in a global map until cancellation and will retain some memory. Note that under a lot of GC pressure a container may choose to destroy a servlet (and run `init` again when another call to that servlet happens). In this circumstance `FlowableHttpServlet` is designed to cancel all outstanding subscriptions and release the mentioned map for gc. 

## Design
WebSockets is a natural for this but can be blocked by corporate firewalls so this library starts with support for HTTP 1.0. 

We want API support for these actions:

* subscribe
* request
* cancel

Support is provided via these URL paths

Path | Method | Action | Returns
--- | --- | --- | --
`/`   | GET | subscribe with no request | Stream ID then binary stream
`/?r=REQUEST`|GET | subscribe with initial request | Stream ID then binary stream
`/?id=ID&r=REQUEST` |GET| request more from given stream | nothing
`/?id=ID&r=-1` |GET| cancel given stream | nothing

The format returned in the subscribe calls is (EBNF):

```
Stream ::= Id Item* ( Error | Complete )?
Item ::= Length Byte*
Error ::= NegativeLength StackTrace 
StackTrace ::= Byte+
Complete ::= NegativeMinLength
```

### Stream

### Item

### Complete

### Error

The core of the library is support for publishing a `Flowable<ByteBuffer>` over HTTP. Serialization is a little optional extra that occurs at both ends.

### Nested Flowables
I have a design in mind for publishing nested Flowables over HTTP as well (representing the beginning of a nested Flowable with a special length value). I don't currently have a use case but if you do raise an issue and we'll implement it.

## Throughput
Peak throughput with embedded jetty server and client on same host is about 1.3GB/s for 64K byte array items.

Throughput drops considerably for smaller byte arrays (because of overhead per array and frequent flushes):

| ByteBuffer size | Localhost Throughput (MB/s) |
| ---------------: | -----------------: |
| 2 | 0.27 |
| 4 | 0.53 |
| 8 | 1.2 |
| 128 | 17 |
| 512 | 68 |
| 2K | 245 |
| 8K | 744 |
| 32K | 1156 |
| 64K | 1300 |
| 128K | 1340 |
